## Article Summary
The first article describes the various NoSQL DBMS and the differences between them. First, the author describes the traditional relational database which, utilizes the relational model and is managed using SQL. The relational database model ensures consistency; however,  it is not horizontally scalable and is not as effective at organizing unstructured data. As a result of these limitations, NoSQL databases were introduced. NoSQL databases are largely characterized by the fact that the DBMS does not use a relational model, maximizes availability, and eliminates redundancies. The article mentions four types of operation database models. These include key-value store, columnar database, document store, and graph database. Key-value databases utilize associative arrays to store relevant information associated with a unique key. Next, Columnar databases stores data in columns, with each column being stored in various parts of the system's storage. Thirdly, Document databases store data in documents with unique identifiers for each document with the ability to also search based on metadata. Lastly, Graph databases, often seen as a type of document database,  also stores data in documents; however, the relationship between each document is highlighted. 

The second article introduces the concept of data lakes, data lakehouses, and data warehouses. Data warehouses consist of high-quality data that is reliable and has high performance. However, data warehouses also require structured data and are expensive to maintain. In contrast, a data lake is a central repository with raw data that is inexpensive and durable. Data lakes are especially useful for data scientists in that raw data can be converted to structured data for various data science applications. Data lakes, however, do not support transactions, are not secure, and are slow when scaled. A data lakehouse addresses these needs by including a top transactional layer and allows for individuals across various professions to utilize the data in an open format.
