## *Introduction*
The number of attacks on networks has dramatically grown over the past several years. As a result, protecting the network security of various network systems is a growing concern for both businesses and consumers alike. Traditional defense systems such as network-based defense systems need additional capabilities in order to mitigate advanced-level threats to IDS systems. This paper will explore looking at the capabilities of big data analytics coupled with modern IDS systems to serve as a powerful tool in deterring cyber threats to networks. Specifically, big data tools can be incorporated into anomaly-based techniques to evaluate large-scale network traffic and alert individuals when security breaches occur. Overall, the advantages of big data: such as speed and efficiency, can be effectively translated into the space of cyber defense in order to modernize intrusion detection systems.

## *Paragraph # 2*

- Discussion about the two main methods for intrusion detection
  -  Anomaly based detection vs signature-based intrusion detection
  -  Why big data tools are best suited for anomaly based intrusion detection


- General history of anomaly based detection systems  


- Shortcomings of current anomaly based detection systems and how big data tools can be used to mitigate them 
    - Specifically looking at the high-false positive rates that exists due to overfitting 
    - Possible way of addressing this by larger training set (made possible by big data tools) and potentially a deep learning model
