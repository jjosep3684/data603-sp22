## Utilizing Big Data Analytics for Cybersecurity

The number of attacks on networks has dramatically grown over the past several years. As a result, protecting the network security of various network systems is a growing concern for both businesses and consumers alike. Traditional defense systems such as network-based defense systems need additional capabilities in order to mitigate advanced-level threats to IDS systems. This paper will explore looking at the capabilities of big data analytics coupled with modern IDS systems to serve as a powerful tool in deterring cyber threats to networks. Specifically, big data tools can be incorporated into anomaly-based techniques technology to evaluate large-scale network traffic and alert individuals when security breaches occur. Overall, the advantages of big data: such as speed and efficiency, can be effectively translated into the space of cyber defense in order to modernize intrusion detection systems.
